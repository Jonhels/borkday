Borkday is a simple discord.js bot that can be used to play youtube songs in your discord server. It is based on the discord.js library and uses the ytdl-core library to play youtube songs.

To start the server you need to have a discord bot token. You can get one by creating a new bot at the discord developer portal.

## Hosting and running the bot
You can either host the bot yourself on your local machine by rinning node index.js or you can host it on a server. I recommend using a service like Railway to host the bot. To configure the bot on railway you just need to connect a new github repository and add the following environment variables that you find under configuration.

## Configuration
To configure the bot you need to add the following environment variables:

// This is the token for the discord bot. You can get one by creating a new bot at the discord developer portal.
DISCORD_TOKEN =

// This is the client id of the bot. You can get it from the discord developer portal.
CLIENT_ID =

// This is the guild id of the server where the bot will be used. You can get it by right clicking on the server icon in discord and selecting "Copy ID".
GUILD_ID =

// This is for alvins birthday, but you should probably change it to your own. The nodescheduler is inside the index.js file.

BIRTHDAY_CHANNEL_ID =


## Installation
npm install should install all dependencies.

## Usage
This bot is free to use and modify. I only made this bot to have it in my own discord server, but since i have it public on github you can use it as well. This bot is ment to be a template for any discord bot that you want to create. You can use the code as you like, but please give me credit if you use it in your own project. From Jonhels
